# GitHub Micro Project

a single-page application that displays a user’s GitHub projects and lets you view the project’s README.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Static Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## What's Included

- `npm run start:prod`: Production ready build.
